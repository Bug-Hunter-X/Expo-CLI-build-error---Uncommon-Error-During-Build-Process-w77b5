3. Install dependencies: `expo install`
4. Attempt to build the application using Expo CLI: `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios`

## Solution

The solution involves [insert brief description of the solution].  Details are provided in the `AppSolution.js` file.  This solution addresses the underlying issue causing the build failure without affecting the application's functionality.

## Note

The exact error message may vary based on the Expo CLI version and project configuration. However, the core problem and the provided solution should remain relevant.
